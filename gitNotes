when you localize a local git repo - it will create a branch called master


git checkout = will switch branches
git checkout -b = wil create the branch and switch to it
git branch = will tell you all the branches and the one your on
Git branch <name-of-branch> - will create a branch (not switch to it)
Git checkout
Git checkout -b <name-of-branch>


if you are in a branch and make changes, commit, then your changes are specific to that branch
HEAD is the current version your in on your code
git merge <name of branch> - will merge the <name of branch> into the current change
git branch -d <name of branch> - will delete <name of Branch>
